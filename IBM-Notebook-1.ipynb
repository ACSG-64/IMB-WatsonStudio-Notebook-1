The fact of being able to analyze enormous amounts of data and to give them value with the help of technology allows us to understand the world in an integral way, relating diverse variables to generate a vision with a lot of value of our environment allowing us to improve our activities, to enrich the capacities of our inventions or to plan appropriate strategies to achieve success._"
